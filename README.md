# MakeChange

This is my first Java programming assignment, "Cash Register." I am creating this before learning the most vital
aspect of Java, objects. Using what I have learned in one week, I used arrays and a counter to implement
making change within this program. The arrays were the denominations of money; both bills and coins. I used the counter 
to count down the change needed. The counter starts at the largest denominations within my arrays and uses that denomination 
until the value gets too small for that denomination and moves on to the next denomination down. It does this until there
is no more value left. For the bills I used casting to make use of integers. For the coins, I used the float variable before
being truncated into an integer value and then subtracted the integer value from it. This gave me the remainder of money
needed for the coins.
